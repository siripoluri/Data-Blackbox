# Data Blackbox
Data Blackbox 

Privacy-first browser extension + analytics dashboard that reveals how websites track your data.
The project captures outgoing network requests in real-time, classifies domains as first-party vs third-party, and visualizes them in a local dashboard.

Built as a showcase of full-stack engineering and privacy/security tech.

Features: 

Browser Extension (Chrome/Firefox, MV3)

Captures all outgoing requests (fetch, XHR, WebSocket, main_frame)

Deduplicates requests to avoid noise

Sends anonymized events to a local backend

Local Backend (Express + SQLite)

Stores unique domains with hit counts

Classifies requests as first-party or third-party

Exposes APIs for dashboards (/domains, /event)

Future Extensions

Next.js dashboard with interactive Sankey diagrams

One-click block/allow rules

Packaging for Chrome Web Store

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Extension: TypeScript, Chrome WebExtension APIs (MV3)

Backend: Node.js, Express 5, SQLite (better-sqlite3)

Database: Lightweight local data.db

Planned Dashboard: Next.js + D3.js

Setup Instructions
1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/data-blackbox.git
cd data-blackbox

2. Backend (Server)
cd server
npm install
npm run start


Server will run at http://localhost:3001

Endpoints:

POST /event ‚Üí log a domain

GET /domains ‚Üí fetch all stored domains

3. Extension (Chrome/Firefox)
cd extension
npm install
npm run build


Then in Chrome:

Open chrome://extensions

Enable Developer Mode

Click Load unpacked ‚Üí select the extension/ folder

How It Works

You browse any website.

The extension intercepts outgoing requests.

Each domain is recorded locally:

First-party = same site you‚Äôre visiting

Third-party = trackers, CDNs, ads, analytics

The backend aggregates counts and exposes APIs.

(Planned) Dashboard visualizes the data as an interactive Sankey map.

Roadmap

 Build Next.js dashboard with D3 Sankey visualization

 Implement allow/block rules synced via Supabase
